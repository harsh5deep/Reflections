Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Git allows for collaboration when there are multiple users working on different component of a project. Manually pulling enables us to pull the info only when we need it , for example if user A has developed the feature and user B wants to review it and later integrate into master

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forking is cloning someone else's repository and creating a personal repository on GitHub. Changes pushed from the local machine do not get pushed to the original repository.
	
	Cloning involves creating a local repository using the HTTPS/SSH link for the repository on GitHub
	
	Branching is used to  create a seperate set of commits while keeping the master branch unafeected . This helps in building new features in parallel without actually affecting the master brach.
